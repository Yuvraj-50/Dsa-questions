# question instruction :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
# 
# Given the array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop. There is a special discount for items in the shop, if you buy the ith item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[j] where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i], otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

# Return an array where the ith element is the final price you will pay for the ith item of the shop considering the special discount.

# Example 1:

# Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
# Output: [4,2,4,2,3]
